flake diamond of
-the sea
the shimmering sand
dilation shadow in rain
black the somehow disfiguring
weed or the smell from
some deep childhood
clogged dry strings the
periwinkle crust
of sewage newspulp the sea breathing
out and in
to high air
not visible
sprays mountain
flower in storms
when under the surface
the fish bank
and give murk
stems knuckled formicant ice
water down
grass by the sea
in quiet smells
a little way
