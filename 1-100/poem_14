Near the beginning
she fed him peanuts in the zoo
which quieted
surrounded by a civilization
the bear and the odd monkey
pawed
at nothing
the fleas in the meshed air
their suitable hides
and the visible flies
the monkey businesslike
the peacock unsurprised
and earth
the dirt was simple
the keeper at meals
retreated to dark huts
holding his hand near a cage
he supported the sun
it had rained some days before
and the sunset was cloudy
