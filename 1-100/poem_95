great multiple
time bare
track
a line
of clear windows
a space set
the city
yard
jaws
of music continual waste
a vast pine
the town
room for woods
how much could you place in the sky
the river
what's your shape
dust floating around how many
thrust down
to final seconds
as if under the boards
mounting papers
days and nights lower
beside roots in the earth
close off the winter, like death
the splits you go in
the rounds of idea
the panels vaulting
teeth or diamond eyes
confronted in the street
Sibelius, shaking like the rain
the vibrations wet
relief
there's narrow joining
or some book you move on seas
the hillsides of the past
the mouths of burrows light
