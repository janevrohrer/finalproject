1959 # 4 g
down the street in the sunlight
in the sunlight, the back seats
it always looks like new
the moment was strange
the bare shot branches
the flat-jacketed boys
the sun cloud changes
hydrant sides
wearing their knees
in the cold,
not their houses glassy
doored flames
down to the ground
nourishing dogs
rough
a local cloud strays out
freshened the hill without snow
a slant way from night, on
those branches where the roofs twist
leaves burrowing distance
