"Keep at it," they say when they see L.
reading, then disappear down the front steps
and plenty die, playing the black market
a heart attack in middle age
c. 1952-August 69
in the blackout
waiting for death, wanting sleep
and the walls had nothing more to reflect
world
the sea
a shock wave
and fliers a mile away
were planes of another country
Afterwards the sun came around
and they say how
stars will collide
