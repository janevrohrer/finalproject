1959 # 7 g
Plenty of time
but I can't sleep nights
Life is static after all
nothing before a man but a woman
the kaleidoscope of
sheep on a stone wall
the mails are unimportant
the poles
running through infinity
rain spindle the sun
they hop keep your eyes on
them
they
form themselves into waves
numbers
and disappear
They were going nowhere
but it takes time
no good,now to find
the heart beat
suddenly the window seems washed
the newspapers falling in the
opposite bathroom
I'm right in the reflection
permanent
radio ads
the clarity distant from gravel
the meadow dying
