Night. Everything falls flat
The dump of the world. Even within gravity,
the cold. There is a woman
playing piano we do not see color
for some space There were green trees, the country.
The houses were farminghouses. The phonograph, too
simple as a road. The ceiling is white
And somewhere now clouds leave the sky
Look at it, the keyboard's marking time
inside like a harp something
breakable, it's as if eternal
the thing drags out, had to be figured out
a long time back she remembers the tones
in FRance. There will be some years after this
after last year
she wears glasses
at least in giving a study, patience
echoes leaves, distantly
blocking the window
in the broad dark
at the muffed room
