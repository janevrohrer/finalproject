the white shirts there
how
to revolve
the sea
the ceiling, blends
in the sky
the rim
beams
buckets of the ocean
un peu de deliberate gull
above music sleers back,
tours horns, pulls
away
d e la m e r
(my old pal )
expression
listeners
for the horizon
jog
thought
gallery
or the body
sit still, why not
arms of sand
some other time
you bring on a fisherman
it was one end of the beach
mixed with the forest
a dark ground
a horseman, slowing for the distance
to disappear
and echo
the twig
thread of sound fold wind
this union, 00 pieces
at full scale
come out a million more names
above the town
at night, where the beach is, cold
containers
