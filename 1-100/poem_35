The paradox of
the Invisible
once visible
my painful
mystery
heading out
the sun
rayon
not here moving, but bent
a river
with ducks curves
and floats
welcome that
appearance
the whole is divided as you look
and know well enough
gleaming in front of the black
bound to imagine
how
in sleep it is no strain
poems
of the subdued trees
the huge depths
may be easy death
soundless no doubt
shaken by morning light
easily
to enhance itself
with afternoon
stars
and sea air
Water of the flat hood
night on the moon
