BRINK
the less I
take for granted
the world going forward
I am getting
no younger
an illusion of this
no, a
death
announced
Sometimes a squirrel
affectionate dogs
nosing in spring
off the corners
cars, carts
on final levels
stretched up
and the overhead craft
in all weather
like windows
Whales
conduct a feast
near the cold used surface
awave like floes
the broken-off scraps
smells
the huge climate
o a lively day
keen
light, imperceptible turn
coffin of justice
among bottles and fruit
the beach I hear not quite
the next road
dancing
pavement of threads, things
horns bicycles papers
on hands
because the street-light shines
steady
and the leaves fall
like a few stars
throughout the night
and the trees moving their bones
in the wind
which doesn't need light
the cold wind Lethe
the strong wind they sleep
the objects of a dream
growing
letting their
hands, such as they have, down
they are unconscious of
the sun
A response
the muffled trees
Later it snows
that is, after the
leaves and the sun
Considerable time
variety of paths
through the same space, thickens
and piles up
what was maybe fog
when the sea smelt
and came back
as it comes back
now
the tides
the sun spinning
the moon having its
different sides
the world
hardening
the trees pore
white under the shadows,
the fading, loose sea
