The cats like children
(do push-up) come have supper The Little League
shouting in unison at
boot training I hadn't looked at the ground
for a while
no more exhausted
than it was patches
of that big snow, since
weeks have passed it was
an unusual depth, the
long lines, and the thought how
nothing would stay much
It came almost to the windows or
far enough Others
to halt the mind We do not beware of the cold
from memory, except
when far gone The horizon
is not there
bicycle spills it
wasn't a joke He got some pain
candy in his face also, it might have been his last,
he picks up and rides on That is where
you stretch and get bigger
The temperature
went up and down;
a few weeks The tree-stump alive
in front of me Children
come in, men
eaters Cats
have outlasted threads, reflections
stopped in the night to be
baled by the sun
