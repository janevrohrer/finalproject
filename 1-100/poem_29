1959 #6 d
THE WANDERING MOSQUITO
into my face
among the masses
When does he go to sleep
I forget he's irregular
Is there any sleep,at all,for him,
before death?
he wanders miles and miles and
becomes aware of the window
where the moon is
in a short time
the peg-board
and it's raining outside
94 humid
he hasn't hurt me yet
I have to open the window
his head is a constant drop of blood
