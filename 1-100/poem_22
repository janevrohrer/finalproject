1956
G r o u n d 
today the rubbish truck
has a green body
it is autumn here the leaves still on the trees
early, though distant morning, forenoon sun,
immediate struggle, bent
card, cans, boxes,
dusts, a toy
shovel, a bottle, assorted pages,
wrapping, socks, the iron to a mattress
but no bone
or, since the war, cat-scraps
there was once a hound burying one
until he placed the right barrel
smoky straw stamped out in the wind
packing parked minute
on minute
as far as I can remember
it has always been full, the eventual stations
progress
when it's about to rain
the green slats again
today put up like a wall, filling
the gap in one side
garbage long, low and slant-roofed
and the ice-cream goat that reputedly ate tin
perhaps in Bolivia
a clean pediment behind
and they all used to dump out back of my house
the loads piled high
moved in the wind
they stick
heaved up over the shoulder,
like hay in a nest, stomped
down, ashes, that barked music,
however
apotheosis
idle from
the teeming field
pin buttons
the queer shine in the weather
to rust
The river of waste
swiftly, the rain speeds
and slows up
not like when I was a boy, change-over,
the earliness
as tomorrow
and the next day
