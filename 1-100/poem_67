loneliness, existence
this is the fine flower and
the bodies in a ring
the geometry
some substance given the stuff of
the earth,imitable
air
the graces in a car
gun
and exhaust the word is familiar now and the curves
perfect as straight lines
Barefoot to match
the atmosphere, a
plain for the distance, the
slung horizon
