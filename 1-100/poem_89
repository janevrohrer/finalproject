Washing between the buildings
Holland the clear sky
over the hay-loading
the clouds'
brief rise a temperate substance
as if the white mortar of history
the grounds of people canals
mirror the overhung banks dividing
bridges and is water deep what
opens the roots as calm
oblong
even the streets are shining
What happened
to fire, the clouds
out of hand, the machines'
free fall, sewers
fouled up, accuracy
of destructive laws
Measure of bridges, into the endless boats of water with
those who would waste
monument to the underground
suicide, and the reckless put it off
to the next moment
quiet
fog
roof of trolleys
cobbled
floods
night
mills like a tiller
varying distance of wind
