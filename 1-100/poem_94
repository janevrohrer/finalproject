September 3 61
mist of quiet
up to the clouds blind
another hot day
industry, suits off
in Yiddish roll up the sleeves
after the cemetery
the car
window
over american toy
plastic,inc ink
the night developed
with stars at marine
supplies the bridge lifts
clearing water
the choppy seas, continuing
here theyâ€™ve made it
the billboards don't peel
there are years now gulls
or lights on their edges the dining places are fine
they buy their fish
70 feet away
and the brick school
is quiet with its lawn
and stone corners, a street at the side
