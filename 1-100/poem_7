Noise grimaced
we took pleasure in the heavens
the close sky
although we knew we could not have seen it
and the flash fell expanding the light
up the beds and walls at once
dying, leaving the star distant
although we had known all season's heat
like a room's still air here
slowly I have sometimes heard my ears click
as if some naked siftings bared themselves
and who know how these needles come to the body
Another moment Day passing or
beside it,
out of the corners of the eyes
the wind like the rain, it can't be swallowed
rain as rain, walls shut in
virtue of walls, Rain is a forest
but the wind is too light for a sea
Under it still the skin is unquenched
And there are not two dangers either
none moving away, in front forwards
to my head
though sometime it will rain, hail or
still more variety
gripping the shoulders
before or after our deaths
