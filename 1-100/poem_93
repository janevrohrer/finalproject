March-April 61 # a q
the dead
light
the walls
no stream but
the union
things are
the wonder
tree
thing see now
pole corner
front moon sliced
sun
catch light shadow
a screen flopped
loose
it was one of those blizzards, one
on another
the shadow of slow
day
passes
the gulls flying around
ruddering balance
the wind lit
eastward it seems
maybe it's the stars
a little lower at night
a broken-up plane there is
touch sea
there is
the wind
I was disappearing into the sunshine
you live the
hopeful
life
to see
depth to the moon
