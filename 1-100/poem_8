1952
O p e n
They nod at me and I at stems
Yes, I agree But I flower myself,
or can't change
Yes, passes. As I,pass on the air
As i, pause
As i dream, sight
I have been on all sides
my face and my back
Disappears any time a world can
Reality dissolve
abstract, abstract, O little
seeing that word
blue against the stackâ€”
o i walk i walk
the pavements
assume they are yellow
the flowers seem to nod
