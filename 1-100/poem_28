August 59 # 5 d
getting old
poems about
fences and vines
on earth, while the sky
holds the quiet
fantastic dimensions
masses and bits
through which the sun might glare
the attempt at standing still
to show nothing is worth
the final deliberations
the motors and
islands
scattered to infinity
we had a thunderstorm here yesterday and
today's expected again
pleasant
In August the leaves turn out
to a slow wind
