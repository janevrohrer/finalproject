October 59 # 1 L
Emptiness, house, the wind
a mere buffer in the trees
not just a sound, exercise stripped
for another
seasonal attempt the clouds have moved off
the sky is blue ravines
alter behind the branches this is what they have been waiting
for
unconsciously
it is lasting all day
What
are birds for?
rivers
to the crotches cliffs
ocean drops turbulent the dying
leaves, the street which
one night, will escape ridden
cover the seeds, how
can they take on
the broad dance,
the numb bark, wild,
the wind streams on
