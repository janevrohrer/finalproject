those crooked houses
the way standing
the sky packs clouds, mute
like summer ice
stream of trees
wreathing to the ear
a bird in
the porch and over
the next roof
by
the least curve
tangent
as beyond a nest a
window
edge-piece
steepened leaves
the clouds were not
fast high-flagged visored
hulls hurrying
a sure place
blue and now
anything might wait
over the line
and now
a little to the side
it's like the zenith
that purple of
stars the sun as slow
