Miasma of art
The 
more the merrier is my view 
seeing the levels of the world and how easily emptied space 
is
Here they made the perfect pots 
on the beastly floors 
the spoons and knives randomly dealt 
and tread on the pine-cones 
bare-footed 
to cut wood 
and here, the women went undone 
till noon, plaiting

and the cooks brought food to their seniors in wigs
in dressed-stone mansions;

but how should I direct my attention
sufficiently to what I desire, to
stop, to
what is charging on the roadbed, what
going away, the
fire-gong, people and busses
and even in my room, as
I know
the waving sun
the
constant ephemerals
