April 1945
Sonnet
Sometimes, at night, when I can hear the ocean,
After a hot and sultry summer"s day,
It sweeps me with a smooth and mighty motion
Into a land of dreams, a phantom bay.
And landing there, I stand upon the beach.
Looking about me, I can see a light
On the horizon: far beyond my reach,
A star is falling towards it in the night.
The air is moistened by a drop of rain.
Here are no burning suns, no hot sands baking.
Within the confines of my little brain,
There seems to be a world of my own making.
I see a million stars and in my hand
I sift a thousand grains of moonlit sand.
