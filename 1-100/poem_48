October 59 # 5 L
the rain
rank draping bale
radios of the world even the
tall buildings from a distance under our
dust covers capacitors
along stone the
industry cloudy roofs
with washline days balls
have peaked the 4th floor and
accelerated the negative
furnitures sections of the sidewalk
the shorefront a few
streets over arias
cathedral a separate pocket
actually, in the other direction
,towering
arches with trees, ivy
to the middle of
country boughs, the wind
wades and the rain
down importunate as a
cat
hanging out magnificent
coal slides and sooty
arms of the burners drams
chipped rims of the basement wells
steaming to the jungle
erect brassed through the bedrooms and
office labelled panes as the
water flushes down behind a
dentist ranged with the
sheriff the
public staircase insurance
behind doors standing
open in hot weather inside
where a cat emerges
who scrabbled the windows mineral
water the
sort of escalator he, suddenly
is, beyond the
narrows geranium grill
like the
trellis we've platted out
woodwards advancing the
old orchard view the mind
not refinable
from the kitchen where
faggots are not housed 
splinters in the rain
or high sun
that sound,
a real autumn in gusts
to dispose of summer
leaves
