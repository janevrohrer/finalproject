I will have an image
of quiet at hand
it floats away
I don't grasp
by the beach
sand ugly enough
night is cool
stars pass
over
again
the rocks tamed
sea
but no strength to travel
a lot of ends the paths
destroy places
as time
the miraculous series
so you may awake
to streets in the morning
and maybe rain
the sun already up
