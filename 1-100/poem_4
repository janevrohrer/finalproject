c. 1952-53
The midnight birds remind me of day though they are 
out in the night 
beyond the curtain I can't see 
Somehow bedrooms don't carry tradition I 
and the boxed radio 
is off. But what am I reading 
inward performance 
Has relevance. Allows me to hear
while something speaks. As for the bed
straightened by visible hands 
only is it huge 
when I feel down in darkness
