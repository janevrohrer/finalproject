like a sock in the earth
holed
wordless room bird
seeming broken
from upstairs
the plaster Indian pane
doorstep the archway
resurrect anytime Venus
wooden remember green
sun shadow the rain
spoils a skylight
in the farther distance up
a ramp victory
waiting
the shelter
of old bombs
past glass and hat and coat
trees corners
stand
harmonic of time
and the outcroppings
elsewhere under
â€œall that art
and"the old spring" siphoned
to the sewage round the park
sleeve
enough cove
a special exhibition
for the blind
horses
axe crests
stones , sticks, native
against rifles
58
against the walls
