LETTER FOR DUNCAN
just because I forget
to perch different ways
the fish
go monotonous
the
sodden hulks of the trees
in a glorious summer
you don't realize
how mature you get
at 21
but you look back
wherever a summer
continue 70 seasons
this one
has been so various
was the spring hot?
every habit
to read
nothing you've done you have
older
the fish
can't bother screaming
flap by hook
the working pain
jaws by trying a head bodies
you'll always go to sleep
more times than you'll wake
