Environ s
Many shapes of wings
on the sky and the table;
and large men carefully at dusk
lengthened by lights watering their lawns
turn, paterfamilias
and the sweet hay as I go
from one foot to the other
more so than I might
mingled with barberâ€™s tonic
from the morning's shops
of papers and bright rag
as if we could
take time out for life
and the afternoon's seas, like yards
At some smell of smoke
I found a spray behind me
and the two on my right gone
tending the grass, all night
everyone beautifully
(by themselves the same thing
time for the surroundings
against the strip of hill
ending low, a space
on this side, hut for clouds
