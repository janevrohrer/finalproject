March 1 60 # 9 q
the trees stand in the wind
the sea an inversion
roaring,other places the branches
heeled
out front of the flagpole
the attics of houses
up the hill, cradles
emptied in this light
breast
of a million arms
snow gone from the ground
the cars pass off in the wind
wires dancing at walls
cool clouds silence the flow
