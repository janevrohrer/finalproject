Islands
My backyard the stars that
wind should be hard at the corner
nightly the lavish bed
taking me nowhere how
I grew up thinking with time
that doesn't the sky
deserted, dark, made the oceans
cold, the sand
damp, hard many dawns have flushed up
and the coast has a road at the
houses turned over boats
which may be narrower than
when they ride out in the bay
and further still into
the quiet, nearly equal
on both sides the nets
and the shaded map of the cliff
elsewhere
beginning to sleep
the cricket drills
constant in the field
