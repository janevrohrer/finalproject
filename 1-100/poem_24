yes, Wolfe
this harvest, harbor of stars
the up-turned mirror in the window
earth on my bureau
I the blank face
i pale and tremendous
dawn, blinding
eyes over the sun
sodden and unfamiliar
the hours change
to the south
I
a man's proper stature
project
I've been a bad boy
no personal god,because
we couldn't settle down
too big to
ride rails
freight
it's true, at the heavy back, all of us, those
tapestries are light
your face forming
too great a height
into a grave
a hole in the lawn
or the brick steps
robins may eat worms
or fallen leaves
the suns
work
to have a good
time
all
together
a baby comes fictitiously
into the world
he seizes as concrete
Milestones the caterpillar's
inch
unable ever to gauge
butterflies
and the thrashings of man
making the seasons heavy
the moon thin
as may be 
bees
they sleep
bows of the spring
again
fish
near a rough tank
steep
inland
behind waves
the piers splintering
simple pieces of light
That lump of a moon, in the sky
past like anything you want
complete
all seen with different eyes
fading off slowly, halves
by halves
divided windows
bring in the shattering depths
then clouds
I think what passes over our heads
are the huge things
lightning, blind
split
naked immensities of the whole
the stroke of it
bars over the street
and poles no higher than the leaves
branches
time intact of the body
invisible extent
Leaving myself, I leave eternity
God, Melville said, nearly to begin
yet the moments are undivided; window-frames are objects
occupying nothing
but plain space
streamlined? hardly, you’d say
except in parts
and a little odd, too, and
always both sexes way
inside, millions of islands, as
rough an element as we've got, but
Wind, there are other things
like stripping and handling parts
as we find them, propping them there
to be more attractive why
that fish, driven all over
by it like a storm by which she sailed
enough staging
to float on, but not with their wives
a fine business, even so
whatever size you please
That island, too, spread one white eye
which we give it
if we can
(caveat
the parts relating to each other
not even the absolute
The sky was empty, right above my head
emptiest of all, above the gutter
when the gulls passed on
with no particular smells
and the leaves held to the puddle
reflecting the wall thin window
the new house
like a junction, complex craft, tenting
the train railing off
where the sun blazed on the stainless door
for a couple of hours
below which I couldn't see
I couldn’t walk far enough
to stand over it
those leaves about the first to come down
Identify the earth with consciousness
they were lost
standing
for some time, time
all those points to the compass
the weather arrived
by such a manner
painting on over the sun
the landscape brought home by sound
noise
the jet spines spread in the sky
there
is the waste tractless?
of outline no possible
but somehow it's hard
circular that's
event
but the permanent gets more commonplace
quick
moments pulling what memory
