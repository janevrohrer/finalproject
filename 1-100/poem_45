September or October 59 f 4 L
These are the
winners of the game motorcycles
him ahead she looking
behind
the wind in lids
a town clouds clear under
fresh morning
a ride through noon transmute forever
the seasoned old dr.
who exuded the hard human
breath legacy of latin
from the chair usual organs the brief
wounds of the still young out on the field
in a slouch
the season of winners and
everyday hoo-ray for
ribboned school lean out the windows to
beachwagon pound, as long as you pass
ivory
shocked cars the indians, coming
going with
the secret clearings of
moments that are hidden
by trees, ramifications
deepening leaves when they
beat the bleachers at the
ultimate reading
ravines
felt downward by the squirrel
saturday
the concentration of spectators
blowing their horns, nose, to extend
the band or something, beyond the
ninth choral wave
they made, though the band, at the same time
drums out, like the soldiers they are
like
the siren air raid test
topping if off, become
a feature doom Saturdays an
open city
as the young scatter
and horns again some reason near
sunset
