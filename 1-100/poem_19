D a y s 
Just like when she was little
the cricket sang, but the
sky was remote
this summer
the hen-yards obsolescent
and the walls often not very wide
the bed a ship to sail again
yet more of a ring, dissolving in the waves
she tossed from side to side, there was
nothing under her, there was nothing
under her, to feel, she had gone too far away
.bed,and a quiet night
The clouds went over, the trees grew
out
covered, different from weeds softly off earth in the
non-violent sun
broken)
wires stay on
carrying messages
of no content, but steady
the birds roost
she had moved a moment
the 13th floor
the room all fixed
up the stairs
to the roof the
grating
old heat
outside
the walls
smokes, matches simultaneous with
idea
change
the cellar, all at one time the
room
phone by the window
to do anything
across the country
voyages
somewhere near the beginning
the rain noses in front of your face
when the clouds thicken, the vague increase
gives you a silence
though widest are the blue points
of the ultimate reach, taking itself
to the sides wherever you go
below which the hammer-thin clouds
beach their imperceptible ways
she lies at the world
in thought, as before
looking up again, without need of a bed
or thinking, where there used to be hens
fallen asleep
