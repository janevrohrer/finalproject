Screaming woman
o god god please god
beyond wall angles
my last night
a further
reminder expected now I go home wherever
it is Enough plenty
changing of sheets these
beds high
The double sashes open
minutes balmy outside
and times the city lay bright
autumn as
tenacious buildings smoke
wooden and back up the hill
old houses with trees
heads green bent as some grass
all a
mounting of the sky the town again
through the facing window oars
lengthen one pane duplicate
possibilities an ice age, say,
or storms of this level a twister
from land or sea might top
these 4 arms,earth
and others in life to
keep the pigeons from
that side and a schoolgirl
who peered in
the both of us with a
surgical wound i used
to be sick felt
death mounting cool fissure since
nice waters how
you get through with time
the day
crossed unending
by night the two pipes
down the green wall
oxygen suction
who thought
the beds
the interior decorator
the architects ?
