children's sizes are indeterminate
then there's those ones across the road
they live from a lawn split by a driveway
â€”well, let's go in, the kitchen someplace in the middle
the tv in the corner down the aisle ,
the basement window shows the circled grass
the kids have a dog that's ownership
Where he keeps his hat, they sometimes put on
they push the sidewalk for four lots
and
take a diaper car for a milktruck
so a year is a long time
the snow more reflective than the glass
they see coming at moments in their minds
and far away,the trees stay bare
in the fall the cats will spawn, usually
and birds come out in the sky, the nests dry
like crusts, and plants in the earth, fires at the gutter
the hens smelling the chickencoop
or garages hot, ragged water and oils
they rake up the beds with their toys
