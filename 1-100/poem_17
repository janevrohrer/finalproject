The sea dances the heavy lights
below the wall; a distant
crash sinking, matched changes of color
strain and confusion, out of which the storms are bred up
after this hour, hunting for sewage and spells
garages and the back yards
where the arrowheads might sift behind the woods
hammering wings the
hutch the
boat lifting between houses
there is the screening of loam,to
leave the rocks out, pitiful ash
crumb in the dropless afternoon
of wine-cellars, accents
of ancient yeasts and that wire
slant of sky filling our eyes
blind, to run back
the beaten snatches of dust through the rain
or violent cold echo
They hunt clams In a lull
at the sewer outflow we dribble our own banks
dwarfing tin
and blocked sand whistles, gouge
quaking
pebbles floated in the night like ghosts
bird-speckled. The wall reins
the barren grains of sand, bareness of shadow
the mud levels endlessly stilled
awnings endowed serene
Then later
to return and
pop balls on the empty brick
and mortar, (the dirt stirs, the sparrows on the
nest overhead in the drain split jaws
as the sunset, in full, passes down
