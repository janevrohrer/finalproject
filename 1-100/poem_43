1959 # 8 k
a thing about
a plane pulling a sling
letters but how did I
get it down
on paper
below the public
prints on wheels
they deliver the good
which smells
and the miles lie quiet
you can't lower an equation without
resort to zero
What's past?
Let the runway
stop here the old corn grows
invisible mostly
remote
in the sound of people
bathing by a lake
clouds
