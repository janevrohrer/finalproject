the head of his great
grandmother his
pillow dark green
in the hut the vision
here a clock
breaks out
the old
life, of moments
his enemy
naked sleeper naked
riser dream
of the sky walking out to the sun
plain
dirty green
the world
on its islands
river a little
in the surf
foam white
before her eyes, advances
trees
the splintery hard
scurrying
rain
bells
the pressure of hands
light from
your granma
beneath skin
where the dirt got in
some diet of wood
through the lamp nightly
my reflection
a month hollowing
boat
constant faces
out of sight
grubbing
stand up
for breeding
haul
clear
the stump
rubber cushions
the wheels travel
all together
fling stones
welded decks open
mute wind by the bay
change
the field
photograph
take away the furniture
woven
pass of the sun
how the sun passes
cooking fires
a process from
the day
so it goes
maternity
the animal state of
lying down
in comfort
rubbing a damp cloth
closely
looking to the gable
