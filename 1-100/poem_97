last year's pink
poison a notice
the wind howled
yesterday , blew up the tide
beyond the sky-line from trees
through branches even more
the days before
out of
the bark clear half
the garage trellis
two arms of the vine
tack crossed way over
the bare
sun filling the air
the roof melting snowcap
down water past
summer, with the rays
some angle eventually
slips through
the flow '
the inferred motion
from the continuous, your eyes
followed, or being
dance
the remainder was good
the two windows shook
and an outer stream on the
house drainpipe
covering a side
those folds
leak point of the exit
