The fountain of youth is a poetry
and whether we are one minute older
the present always arrives
come as we make it
According to our healths
(when we are sitting still)
but time itself kills
the brush, consumed or not
and the individual
which is needed) dies
necessities dying out
but nothing ends
as everything begins
