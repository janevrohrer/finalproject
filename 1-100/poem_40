The sun and stars
part of the world
a rain
glazed roof
you look out
clouds
about the shape of yesterday
insubstantial
coast
aisle
even after snow, in the cold
where you find them
any animal
grown roots
the
sky exchange of its lids
evening bald
plungers
baying
depths of the land
submerged
a queer
underground
surfacing
towards dead inchoate
fish damp snake
reeds climb
slope
swum by an illusion of a waterfall
borne in
to the country grains
the wave crag
permeated life
slamming up
the imagination
is in the mouth
oceans
tide
unceasing continual
pitches hospitals
the eye sweeps
far out
how much of the earth
