all these long cars
legal on the black roads
a more certain speed
here's mercury again
a mile of stone houses ,
the sea screens the beach
leaves at the top
hill trees
birds flock
we'll never remain
by the coal lighthouse
Let's take to our boats
and crickets' shoes
all kinds
protuberating
snaky
series
