like those bad heads
children have
idea
of the connection
funny
if you stand
under
voices
one end is at the right
and piles
been through a screen
starting sounds
/
familiar tides
single shores
towards night
and steady cold animals
get through the woods
relaxed heads
individual
old man
dream echoes
some increase the vibration
looked into by flies
