An Imitation
(a shot of Rbt Creeley)
What has that face got to do with that
poetry? In
order to have one you need the other, yes
the sky
would do as well I know
Questions are funny, a flower
of life then Let's
go on What are the leaves
in back What's
the sky doing in your head? The
photos of some of your
"predecessors" What
has your voice to do with
the thoughts which at least pass
in my own life, its
hurry
While the churches
are open as the earth There are statues â€¢
in all the museums and
around them now in the park and
even in the wilds
again
and paintings of stars, nights,
in walls
opposite mirrors
