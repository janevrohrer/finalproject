Shafts
a wind
hardly
to listen to
denotes a river
play on
footsteps
material
gapping
woods cloud over
white in the sky
sunny decembers also
and the close months
cliffs
stony perhaps
in the bay
where life too is a wall
there will be ice, and melt
even in descent, or
of course re-frame
the gutters dirty with grit
where the girls took any direction
lodged fins or eyes
actually feathers heads maybe
or arrows
slopes room for all
particles
outlines
