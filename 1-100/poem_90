March 61
Sound and beat swell
funnel of space
dragged in earth
planes eddy, the shaking
cold, fish jump the horizon
slats factory colors
we realize a finish
there is a tower a
vast dome
a dining car there
a sliding seats
sloped down
the girders truckload of stationwagons
a few benches at the sea
or hens crated
traffic island
the oak starlight glimmering with flowers
sometimes the sea does turn warmer
the gulf of cars engraved
from everywhere
the dawning ends of the world
